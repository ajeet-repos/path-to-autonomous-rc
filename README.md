# Path To Autonomous RC

I am creating this repo to serve as a starting point for anybody interested in building their own Autonomous Remote Car. This repo does not and will no contain the code for an autonomous RC, but will only contain information related to hardware list, tutorial links, sensor interfacing code examples, etc.

To keep this repo updated with latest information, I would require help from everybody. If you think something is missing or needs to be updated, please raise a issue or pull request.

I will be happy to merge all the additional information.



# Hardware

This file will contain the details of working hardware list. The information will basically be devided into following sections:

1. Main-Boards
2. RC-Cars (to modify)
3. Camera-Modules
4. Radar-Sensors
5. Infrared-Sensors
6. Motors
7. Screws specs
8. Servo-Motors
9. Power-Banks
10. Wifi-Module


# Tutorials

This will be a folder with working code samples related to anything and everything that could come handy while trying to build an autonomous RC.

Every segment of code has its own folder. A quicky of summary of that will be update below.
